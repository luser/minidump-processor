# minidump-stackwalk CLI manual

> This manual can be regenerated with `minidump-stackwalk --help-markdown`

Version: `minidump-stackwalk 0.14.0`

Analyzes minidumps and produces a report (either human-readable or JSON)

### USAGE
```
minidump-stackwalk [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <minidump> [--] [symbols-path]...
```

### ARGS
#### `<MINIDUMP>`
Path to the minidump file to analyze

#### `<SYMBOLS_PATH_LEGACY>...`
Path to a symbol file. (Passed positionally)

If multiple symbols-path-legacy values are provided, all symbol files will be merged
into minidump-stackwalk's symbol database.

### OPTIONS
#### `--human`
Emit a human-readable report (the default)

The human-readable report does not have a specified format, and may not have as many
details as the JSON format. It is intended for quickly inspecting a crash or debugging
rust-minidump itself.

Can be simplified with --brief

#### `--json`
Emit a machine-readable JSON report

The schema for this output is officially documented here:
#### `<https://github.com/rust-minidump/rust-minidump/blob/master/minidump-processor/json-schema.md>`

Can be pretty-printed with --pretty

#### `--cyborg <CYBORG>`
Combine --human and --json

Because this creates two output streams, you must specify a path to write the --json
output to. The --human output will be the 'primary' output and default to stdout, which
can be configured with --output-file as normal.

#### `--dump`
Dump the 'raw' contents of the minidump

This is an implementation of the functionality of the old minidump_dump tool. It
minimally parses and interprets the minidump in an attempt to produce a fairly 'raw'
dump of the minidump's contents. This is most useful for debugging minidump-stackwalk
itself, or a misbehaving minidump generator.

Can be simplified with --brief

#### `--features <FEATURES>`
Specify at a high-level how much analysis to perform

This flag provides a way to more blindly opt into Extra Analysis without having
to know about the specific features of minidump-stackwalk. This is equivalent to
ProcessorOptions in minidump-processor. The current supported values are:

* stable-basic (default): give me solid detailed analysis that most people would want
* stable-all: turn on extra detailed analysis.
* unstable-all: turn on the weird and experimental stuff.

stable-all enables: nothing (currently identical to stable-basic)

unstable-all enables: `--recover-function-args`

minidump-stackwalk wants to be a reliable and stable tool, but we also want to be able
to introduce new features which may be experimental or expensive. To balance these two
concerns, new features will usually be disabled by default and given a specific flag,
but still more easily 'discovered' by anyone who uses this flag.

Anyone using minidump-stackwalk who is *really* worried about the output being stable
should probably not use this flag in production, but its use is recommended for casual
human usage or for checking "what's new".

Features under unstable-all may be deprecated and become noops. Features which require
additional input (such as `--evil-json`) cannot be affected by this, and must still be
manually 'discovered'.

\[default: stable-basic]  
\[possible values: stable-basic, stable-all, unstable-all]  

#### `--verbose <VERBOSE>`
How verbose logging should be (log level)

The unwinder has been heavily instrumented with `trace` logging, so if you want to debug
why an unwind happened the way it did, --verbose=trace is very useful (all unwinder
logging will be prefixed with `unwind:`).

\[default: error]  
\[possible values: off, error, warn, info, debug, trace]  

#### `--output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>`
Where to write the output to (if unspecified, stdout is used)

#### `--log-file <LOG_FILE>`
Where to write logs to (if unspecified, stderr is used)

#### `--no-color`
Prevent the output/logging from using ANSI coloring

Output written to a file via --log-file, --output-file, or --cyborg is always
#### `--no-color, so this just forces stdout/stderr printing.`

#### `--pretty`
Pretty-print --json output

#### `--brief`
Provide a briefer --human or --dump report

For human: Only provides the top-level summary and a backtrace of the crashing thread.

For dump: Omits all memory hexdumps.

#### `--no-interactive`
Disable all interactive progress feedback

We'll generally try to auto-detect when this should be disabled, but this is here in
case we mess up and you need it to go away.

#### `--evil-json <EVIL_JSON>`
**UNSTABLE** An input JSON file with the extra information.

This is a gross hack for some legacy side-channel information that mozilla uses. It will
hopefully be phased out and deprecated in favour of just using custom streams in the
minidump itself.

#### `--recover-function-args`
**UNSTABLE** Heuristically recover function arguments

This is an experimental feature, which currently only shows up in --human output.

#### `--symbols-url <SYMBOLS_URL>`
base URL from which URLs to symbol files can be constructed

If multiple symbols-url values are provided, they will each be tried in order until
one resolves.

The server the base URL points to is expected to conform to the Tecken
symbol server protocol. For more details, see the Tecken docs:

#### `<https://tecken.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`

Example symbols-url values:
* microsoft's symbol-server: <https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/>
* mozilla's symbols-server: <https://symbols.mozilla.org/>

#### `--symbols-cache <SYMBOLS_CACHE>`
A directory in which downloaded symbols can be stored

Symbol files can be very large, so we recommend placing cached files in your system's
temp directory so that it can garbage collect unused ones for you. To this end, the
default value for this flag is a `rust-minidump-cache` subdirectory of
`std::env::temp_dir()` (usually /tmp/rust-minidump-cache on linux).

symbols-cache must be on the same filesystem as symbols-tmp (if that doesn't mean
anything to you, don't worry about it, you're probably not doing something that will run
afoul of it).

#### `--symbols-tmp <SYMBOLS_TMP>`
A directory to use as temp space for downloading symbols.

A temp dir is necessary to allow for multiple rust-minidump instances to share a cache
without race conditions. Files to be added to the cache will be constructed in this
location before being atomically moved to the cache.

If no path is specified, `std::env::temp_dir()` will be used to improve portability. See
the rust documentation for how to set that value if you wish to use something other than
your system's default temp directory.

symbols-tmp must be on the same filesystem as symbols-cache (if that doesn't mean
anything to you, don't worry about it, you're probably not doing something that will run
afoul of it).

#### `--symbols-download-timeout-secs <SYMBOLS_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECS>`
The maximum amount of time (in seconds) a symbol file download is allowed to take

This is necessary to enforce forward progress on misbehaving http responses.

\[default: 1000]  

#### `--fetch-syms <FETCH_SYMS>`
Whether to query urls for .sym files.

Defaults to `true`.

This mode works with "fake" Microsoft Symbol Servers like Tecken, and is the mode that
breakpad-symbols was designed for. These files are generally significantly smaller than
a codefile or debugfile, where symbols natively reside.

\[possible values: true, false]  

#### `--fetch-native-binaries <FETCH_NATIVE_BINARIES>`
Whether to query urls for native codefiles and debugfiles.

Currently defaults to `cfg!(feature = dump_syms)` (experimental).

Setting this to `true` will do nothing if the `dump_syms` feature isn't also enabled.

This mode works with "real" Microsoft Symbol Servers, and is experimental.

\[possible values: true, false]  

#### `--use-minidump-paths <USE_MINIDUMP_PATHS>`
Whether to try to get symbols from the *actual* codefile and debugfile paths on the
current system.

Currently defaults to `false` (experimental).

Setting this to `true` will do nothing if the `dump_syms` feature isn't also enabled.

The actual codefile and debugfile entries in a minidump are actually complete paths from
either the machine where the program was running, or the machine where the build was
performed. Either way, this means processing a minidump on the same machine that the
crash occured on can yield some symbols at those paths. This works especially well for
local development where "build machine" and "run machine" are the same, and the
executable is still in the build dir with ALL the debuginfo the compiler emitted!

If `cache` is set, we *may* place a `sym` in it to optimize subsequent runs.

\[possible values: true, false]  

#### `--symbols-path <SYMBOLS_PATH>`
Path to a symbol file.

If multiple symbols-path values are provided, all symbol files will be merged into
minidump-stackwalk's symbol database.

#### `-h, --help`
Print help information

#### `-V, --version`
Print version information
